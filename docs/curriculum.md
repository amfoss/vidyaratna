# Curriculum

## Let’s debug the reasoning here — why is this even a thing?

This curriculum is crucial because it offers a structured way to explore the many facets of computer science. While not every topic will resonate with everyone, exposure to a wide range of subjects helps build a versatile skill set. It encourages students to identify their strengths and interests while developing the essential ability to 'learn how to learn.' In this field, efficiently locating precise information is often more valuable than trying to learn everything in depth. By covering diverse topics, the curriculum introduces learners to various branches of computer science, enhancing their overall understanding. Who knows? You may even discover a newfound passion along the way.

### TASK 00: CODEFORCES

**Why Competitive Programming:**

Taking on short-term challenges offers significant benefits by pushing you out of your comfort zone, encouraging rapid learning, and reinforcing old skills. Unlike self-chosen projects, where it's tempting to stick with familiar technologies and avoid difficult problems, these challenges force you to confront new and complex tasks directly, leading to real growth and improvement in your abilities.

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts contests, problem sets, and educational resources, helping users enhance their algorithmic and problem-solving skills. It features a rating system that motivates programmers to improve and engage with a global community through discussions and shared solutions. Codeforces is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to sharpen their coding abilities and prepare for technical challenges.

**Approach:**
<ul>
    <li>Every weekend, practice the latest problems in your rating range and time yourself when doing them.</li>
    <li>After you finish a problem, make sure you reflect on the techniques and mindset used and how you could generalize the thought process to solve other problems more efficiently.</li>
    <li> To practice thinking on your do Codeforces live contests and challenge yourself to solve as many problems as you can in the time frame.</li>
</ul>
<br>

**Objectives:**
<ul>
    <li>Solve as many problem statements rated 1400 or under.</li>

**The following is the list of features that should be included in the website you make and the important points to remember while working on such a project. After reading these, you can continue with task 04, where you will start working on this website by doing the first step, that is, creating an SRS document!**


**The website you are gonna create:**

Letterboxd is a social networking platform for film enthusiasts where users can discover, rate, and review films, as well as interact with a community of like-minded people. It allows users to create watchlists, log films they've watched, and write reviews. Additionally, it offers curated lists, film recommendations, and the ability to follow other users to see their activity.  Visit the site : [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)

<br>

**Features to Adopt for a Similar Website:**

**1. User Authentication:**

Sign-up, sign-in, and social media login.

**2. Search Functionality:**

Search for tasks (or your chosen subject) by title, genre, date, etc.

**3. Task/Item Addition:**

Users can add new tasks or items (like new movies)  with details like description, images, and categories.

**4. Review and Rating System:**

Users can write reviews, rate tasks, and edit or delete their reviews. Remember, other users can review the tasks/items/movies you have created, just like you can rate the ones they have created.

**5. Watchlist/Task List:**

Users can create and manage lists of tasks to complete or review later.

**6. Social Features:**

Follow other users, view their activity, and comment on their reviews.

**7. Recommendations:**
