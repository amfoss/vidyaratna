### TASK 00: CODEFORCES

**Why Competitive Programming:**

Taking on short-term challenges offers significant benefits by pushing you out of your comfort zone, encouraging rapid learning, and reinforcing old skills. Unlike self-chosen projects, where it's tempting to stick with familiar technologies and avoid difficult problems, these challenges force you to confront new and complex tasks directly, leading to real growth and improvement in your abilities.

[Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) is a competitive programming platform that hosts contests, problem sets, and educational resources, helping users enhance their algorithmic and problem-solving skills. It features a rating system that motivates programmers to improve and engage with a global community through discussions and shared solutions. Codeforces is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to sharpen their coding abilities and prepare for technical challenges.

**Approach:**
<ul>
    <li>Every weekend, practice the latest problems in your rating range and time yourself when doing them.</li>
    <li>After you finish a problem, make sure you reflect on the techniques and mindset used and how you could generalize the thought process to solve other problems more efficiently.</li>
    <li> To practice thinking on your do Codeforces live contests and challenge yourself to solve as many problems as you can in the time frame.</li>
</ul>
<br>

**Objectives:**
<ul>
    <li>Solve as many problem statements rated 1400 or under.</li>
    <li>Upon solving each problem add its code with the problem's title as the filename. Also, upload your Codeforces profile link.</li>
</ul>

**Outcomes:**
<ul>
    <li>Aim to elevate your rating to 1400+ (i.e., get into cyan rating).</li>
</ul>

### TASK 03: Build a Simple Shell

Develop a basic Unix shell using C to understand how command-line interfaces work. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with systems programming by developing a command-line interface (CLI) that interacts with the operating system. This project is designed to be an introduction to the inner workings of operating systems and the role of system calls in managing hardware resources and processes.

**Objectives:**
- Implement a command-line interface that reads user input and executes commands.
    - Create a shell that displays a prompt, reads user input, and waits for commands. 
- Parse user input into a command and arguments.
    - Break the input into a command and its arguments. This involves tokenizing the input string based on spaces and other delimiters.
- Execute Unix commands using fork() and execvp().
    - Use system calls like fork() to create a new process and execvp() to replace the child processâ€™s memory space with a new program. This is the core of command execution.     
- Handle built-in commands like cd, exit, and pwd.
- Implement basic error handling to manage invalid inputs.

### Development cycle

There is a journey behind every application or website we see, popularly known as the development cycle.

<ul>
  <li>The development cycle begins with creating an SRS document, which outlines the project's requirements and goals. Creating a proper SRS document is beyond the scope of this curriculum, although you will be making a much smaller version of it here.</li>
  <li>Next, wireframes are developed using tools like Moqups or Figma to establish the basic layout and structure of the website.</li>
  <li>The wireframes are then translated into detailed visual designs using Figma, focusing on the look and feel (UI and UX).</li>
  <li>Following this, front-end and back-end development are carried out, with the front-end handling the user interface and the back-end managing data and server logic.</li>
  <li>Finally, both are integrated to ensure seamless interaction between the user interface and the underlying systems.</li>
</ul>


<br>

**The following is the list of features that should be included in the website you make and the important points to remember while working on such a project. After reading these, you can continue with task 04, where you will start working on this website by doing the first step, that is, creating an SRS document!**


**The website you are gonna create:**

Letterboxd is a social networking platform for film enthusiasts where users can discover, rate, and review films, as well as interact with a community of like-minded people. It allows users to create watchlists, log films they've watched, and write reviews. Additionally, it offers curated lists, film recommendations, and the ability to follow other users to see their activity.  Visit the site : [Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/)

<br>

**Features to Adopt for a Similar Website:**

**1. User Authentication:**

Sign-up, sign-in, and social media login.

**2. Search Functionality:**

Search for tasks (or your chosen subject) by title, genre, date, etc.

**3. Task/Item Addition:**

Users can add new tasks or items (like new movies)  with details like description, images, and categories.

**4. Review and Rating System:**

Users can write reviews, rate tasks, and edit or delete their reviews. Remember, other users can review the tasks/items/movies you have created, just like you can rate the ones they have created.

**5. Watchlist/Task List:**

Users can create and manage lists of tasks to complete or review later.

**6. Social Features:**

Follow other users, view their activity, and comment on their reviews.

**7. Recommendations:**
