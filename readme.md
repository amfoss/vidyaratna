## Linux 

**Why Linux?**
- Open source : apart from Linux's source code being readable to anyone, it also means that there is a whole community to support when you face issues plus it is secure comparing to other closed source OSes.
- Ease of development : programming and development in general, is a far better experience in Linuxthan in other OSes. 
- You do things on your own : there is a lot of learning when you use Linux, you get to understand many things about an OS and a get a touch of how everything works under the hood.

**Installation and Dual-booting**

It is generally recommended to go with the latest LTS release of Ubuntu(18.04 at the time of writing). Ubuntu is one of the most popular Linux distros and is strongly recommended for beginners due to the large community and forums.

**Loooking for a laptop? Here are some suggestions - **

In general most laptops that come pre-installed with Ubuntu are highly recommended. You can also get one without a graphics card to avoid issues with battery life and driver installation. It would be good to research about the Linux support of a particular model before getting it. If possible try to stay away from the very latest, since these devices might not have open source drivers available.

There are an overwhelming number of processors out there, so our suggestion would be to go with a laptop with the latest generation of Intel i3, i5 or an i7 processor. At the time of writing Intel released their 9th gen processor, which have 2 extra cores compared to the previous generation. This is a major update in processing power and we would suggest you to go with the most up to date generation of processors.

If you want to get a device with graphics card it is highly recommended to get one with Nvidia graphics to use the CUDA technology. This might be useful later if you are planing to do machine learning(but there is always the option of using cloud).

With regards of RAM, any system with 8GB or more RAM is going to fine. And if you get one with 4GB, you can usually upgrade it to 8GM or more. Also if you have enough budget you can get your system with a SSD instead of an HDD. howtogeek.com has an in interesting article on why you should be using an SSD.
